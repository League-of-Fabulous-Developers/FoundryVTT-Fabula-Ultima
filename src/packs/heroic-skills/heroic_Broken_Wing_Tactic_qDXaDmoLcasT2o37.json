If you do, choose one option: you and every ally who is able to hear you gain Resistance to all damage types until the end of this turn; or you and every ally who is able to hear you deal 5 extra damage until the end of this turn. Once you use this Skill, you cannot use it again until the start of your next turn.</p>",

If you do, their corpse becomes a <strong>minion</strong> who obeys your telepathic commands:</p><ul><li>Its <strong>Species</strong> becomes <strong>undead</strong> and it receives all <strong>undead rules</strong> (see <strong>Core Rulebook</strong>, page <strong>305</strong>). The new Affinities to <strong>dark</strong>, <strong>light</strong>, and <strong>poison</strong> damage overwrite any preexisting Affinity, but the original Species' rules are otherwise <strong>maintained</strong>.</li><li>Its <strong>Rank</strong> becomes <strong>soldier</strong>; if the original creature was an <strong>elite</strong> or <strong>champion</strong>, the GM must reduce the minion's HP and MP accordingly (Skills are <strong>maintained</strong>).</li><li>The newly created minion is a completely new creature and has full HP, full MP, and no status effects. It retains the original creature's <strong>equipment</strong> (if any).</li><li>Your minion takes its own turn during conflicts, and the Game Master must count it as an <strong>additional Player Character</strong> when designing a conflict.</li><li>When you <strong>rest</strong>, your minion also gains the full benefits of resting.</li><li>If your minion is reduced to 0 Hit Points, if you are <strong>more than 1 travel day</strong> away from it, or if you die or fall unconscious, it is immediately destroyed.</li><li>You may also destroy your minion <strong>at any time</strong>; but during a conflict scene you can only do so on your turn, while no other effect is being resolved. If you want to create a new minion, you must first destroy the current one.</li><li>If your minion is destroyed, your maximum HP and MP scores <strong>return to normal</strong>.</li></ul>",

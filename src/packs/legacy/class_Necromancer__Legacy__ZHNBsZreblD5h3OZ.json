And yet, as if to mock their dark efforts, true resurrection of a lost one remains a mirage…</p><hr /><h5><strong>NECROMANCER FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points <strong>or</strong> Mind Points by 5 (your choice).</li></ul><h2><strong>NECROMANCER SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.legacy.Item.EzqS93ltwsmTqBLM]{Beyond The Realms Of Death [Legacy]} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>When another creature you can see loses Hit Points while in Crisis, if they are not undead, you gain <strong>1 Grave Point</strong>. You may never have more than <strong>【SL + 1】 </strong>Grave Points. When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, you lose all Grave Points; then, if you lost at least 1 Grave Point this way and this is the <strong>first time</strong> you are reduced to 0 HP during this scene, you do not <strong>Surrender</strong> nor <strong>Sacrifice</strong> yourself: instead, you recover an amount of HP equal to <strong>【SL, multiplied by the amount of Grave Points you lost this way】</strong>.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.legacy.Item.3tqp6B59iTFc4eDQ]{Children Of The Grave [Legacy]}</p><p>You can always communicate verbally with <strong>undead</strong> creatures.

If you do, choose one option: if that creature is suffering from one or more status effects, the spell deals extra damage equal to <strong>【(SL × 2) + the number of status effects on that creature】</strong>; or if that creature is suffering from no status effects, they suffer <strong>shaken</strong>.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.legacy.Item.RhpHxrRYyaH3qoYl]{Rondo Of Nightmare [Legacy]}</p><p>When you cast an offensive spell ( @ICON[offensive] ) with a <strong>target</strong> of “One creature”, you may spend 2 Grave Points to have it target <strong>all</strong> creatures you can see that are present on the scene (perform a single Magic Check and confront it with the Magic Defense of each target). If you do, all damage dealt by the spell becomes <strong>dark</strong> and its type cannot change.</p>",

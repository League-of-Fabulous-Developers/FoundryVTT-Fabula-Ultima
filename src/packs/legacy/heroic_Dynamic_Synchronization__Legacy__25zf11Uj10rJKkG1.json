Describe how you join forces! You and the chosen character <strong>both</strong> receive the following benefits as long as the <strong>synchronization</strong> remains active:</p><ul><li><p>When you perform a Check, you may use the current Attribute die sizes of the other Player Character in place of yours (for one or both dice).</p></li><li><p>When you deal damage, deal extra damage equal to <strong>【the strength of your Bond towards the other PC, plus the strength of their Bond towards you】</strong>.</p></li><li><p>You may use an action to perform a <strong>free attack</strong> with one <strong>enabled or disabled weapon module</strong> present on the <strong>personal vehicle</strong> the other PC is currently on.</p></li><li><p>When your turn ends, if the other PC has yet to take their turn during this round, they may take their turn <strong>immediately</strong> after yours.</p></li></ul><p>This <strong>synchronization</strong> lasts until the end of the scene, or until you or the other Player Character die, fall unconscious, leave the scene, <strong>synchronize</strong> with someone else, or are no longer aboard a <strong>personal vehicle</strong>.</p>",

Technosphere Testing Release 1
This version adds the new item types "Mnemosphere" and "Hoplosphere", as well as a new tab in the character sheet. A new compendium containing premade Mnemospheres for the classes described on page 136 of the Techno Fantasy Atlas has been added as well.

The new Mnemosphere sheet allows for adding Skills, Heroic Skills, Spells and Class Features to the Mnemosphere through Drag&Drop. As long as the Mnemosphere is slotted any Heroic Skills, Spells and Class Features, as well as Skills with at least one level will show up in their respective sections on the main character sheet. These items are marked with a changed background and a tooltip indicating where they are coming from. It is not possible to delete these items from the main character sheet, only through the Mnemosphere sheet. Similarly, active effects belonging to items are not deletable from the main character sheet any more.

The new Hoplosphere sheet has two modes: "Unlocked" and "Locked". If the Hoplosphere belongs to a character the sheet is "Locked" by default and disallows most changes. The locked sheet can be unlocked through the "Toggle sheet lock" option in the "Three Dot Menu" in the sheet window header. The unlocked sheet allows configuring specific active effects for when the Hoplosphere is socketed in an armor or a weapon, as well as effects for specific coagulation levels.

Be aware that this version received only minimal polish. I know that there's a million little problems but unless I focus on the actual big problems first, this feature will never get done.
